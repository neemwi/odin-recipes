<h2>Succulant and Savory Jamaican Jerk Chicken</h2>

<p>The best jerk recipe we've ever tasted, which we first 
    published in 1995, is fragrant, fiery hot and smoky all at once. 
    It's from our former colleague Paul Chung, an adventurous self-taught 
    cook who grew up in Jamaica and has sampled jerk from just about every 
    corner of the island. For maximum flavor, let the chicken marinate 
    overnight.In 2018, Food & Wine named this recipe one of our 40 best: 
    There are as many takes on jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are cooks 
    on the island, but most share the same method: Chicken is coated in a
    seasoning mixture dominated by spices and chiles, then grilled. 
    This version comes from Paul Chung, a self-taught cook of 
    Chinese-Jamaican descent who worked in the mail room at Food & Wine.</p>
